# SmartBeings (GithubTopUsers)


# About The Project
## An android application that retrieves top users based on the followers count using the Github API. The user can also search based on a specific user's git handle.

# Views Used
## Recycler View to display the various user profile pictures along with the user handle
## Search View to handle search

# Libraries Used
## Volley - Used for making GET requests to Github API.
## Picasso - To handle user's avatar.

# Data Structures
## Used a seperate class called GitUser to store information about the user. This has been limited to just the user's name and avatar URL. However this can easily be expanded to handle more features, making it a scalable implementation.
